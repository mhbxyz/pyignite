# Post-Alpha Roadmap (Ranked)

This document is updated after each alpha triage cycle using the rubric from `docs/release/triage-alpha-process.md`.

## How to update

For each accepted feedback item:

1. Compute rubric score.
2. Map to priority (`P0`..`P3`).
3. Create/link implementation issue.
4. Add ranked entry below.

## Ranked follow-up list

| Rank | Feedback issue | Follow-up issue | Score | Priority | Area | Owner | Target milestone | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | _tbd_ | _tbd_ | _tbd_ | _tbd_ | _tbd_ | _tbd_ | _tbd_ | pending |
